  # C++ Task Example

  This is a basic C++ task to get you started quickly with Code FREAK.

  To turn this into a useful programming exercise, you have to do the following.

  ## Provide Code to Students

  If you do not want your students to start completely from scratch, provide some scaffolding code. Look into `src` for some inspiration.

  ## Setup Automatic Evaluation

  This example comes with a pre-configured evaluation step. You can see it in the _Evaluation_ tab. To try it out, enter _testing mode_ and start the evaluation.

  ### Static Code Analysis

  The code is anaylzed using [cpplint](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint) for proper formatting, which enforces [Google's C++ code styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide).

  ### Unit Tests

  Unit tests are your main instrument for automatically validating your students' answers. To get started, look into `test` for example test cases.

  The standard testing framework for C++ is googletest. Refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/google/googletest) for more information.
