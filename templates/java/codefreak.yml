  # Java Task Example

  This is basic Java task to get you started quickly with Code FREAK.

  To turn this into a useful programming exercise, you have to do the following.

  ## Provide Code to Students

  If you do not want your students to start completely from scratch, provide some scaffolding code. Look into `src/main/java` for some inspiration.

  ## Setup Automatic Evaluation

  This example comes with two pre-configured evaluation steps. You can see them in the _Evaluation_ tab. To try it out, enter _testing mode_ and start the evaluation.

  ### Static Code Analysis

  The Code is analyzed for proper formatting using the Tool [`Checkstyle`](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle) and [Google's code style for Java](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

  ### Unit Tests

  Unit tests are your main instrument for automatically validating your students' answers. To get started, look into `src/test/java` for example test cases.

  The standard testing framework for Java is JUinit. Refer to the [official documentation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) for more information.
