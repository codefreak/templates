  # JavaScript Task Example

  This is basic JavaScript task to get you started quickly with Code FREAK.

  To turn this into a useful programming exercise, you have to do the following.

  ## Provide Code to Students

  If you do not want your students to start completely from scratch, provide some scaffolding code. Look into `index.js` for some inspiration.

  ## Setup Automatic Evaluation

  This example comes with two pre-configured evaluation steps. You can see them in the _Evaluation_ tab. To try it out, enter _testing mode_ and start the evaluation.

  ### Static Code Analysis

  The code is anaylzed using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for proper formatting (based on [`standard`](https://github.com/standard/standard)) and possible issues.

  ### Unit Tests

  Unit tests are your main instrument for automatically validating your students' answers. To get started, look into `main_test.py` for example test cases.
  
  There are many unit testing frameworks for JS. This example uses [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/). See Jest's documentation how to write unit tests.
